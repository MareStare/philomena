      # container (the `$WORKSPACE` env variable is supposed to be set by
      # `init-host.sh` script).
      #
      # This is needed to work around the problem of relative paths mapping
      # between the container and the host. For example if we use relative paths
      # in `docker-compose.yml`, then they'll be sent to the host's docker
      # daemon using the paths canonicalized within the devcontainer's view of
      # the file system, which will be different from the host's view of the
      # mount. A similar problem occurs with the VSCode docker extension.
      #
      # Having the host and the devcontainer use the same path to the workspace
      # fixes  this and simplifies our life.
